# OpenChess
A Chess application 

## All the Beginner folks! Welcome! â˜ºðŸ™Œ

### What do we do here?

This repo is all about collaboration and bringing a Chess game to life. Currently, the plan is to come up with a Web App and and then a Command Line app.

We are currenly in the ultra initial stage. The trajectory of the path rests on the shoulders of the folks working in it.
